## [0.1.0-beta.2] – 2025-05-23

### Added
- ✅ Support for loading **PHOENIX NewEra model spectra** via `Spectrum.from_grid(model_grid="newera")`
- 📥 Utility function `download_newera_grid()` to selectively download subsets of the NewEra model grid
- 🎯 Filtering options for `teff_range`, `logg_range`, `feh_range`, and `alpha_range` in `download_newera_grid()`
- ⚠️ Warning raised when attempting to download the full grid (~4.5 TB)

### Changed
- 🔧 Improved verbosity and error handling for model downloads

## \[0.1.0-beta.1] - 2024-05-16

### Added

* `Spectrum` class to load and manipulate stellar model spectra.
* Support for multiple model grids: PHOENIX, DRIFT-PHOENIX, SPHINX, NextGen-solar, and MPS-Atlas.
* `resample()` and `regularize()` methods using `pysynphot` for consistent flux interpolation.
* `set_spectral_resolution()` method with Gaussian convolution.
* `bin()` method and `BinnedSpectrum` class for filter binning.
* `SpectralGrid` and `BinnedSpectralGrid` classes for fast interpolation across stellar parameters.
* `Filter`, `SED`, and `SEDGrid` classes for synthetic photometry.
* `apply_filter()` and `mag_to_flux()` utility functions.

### Changed

* Migrated from legacy `tool.poetry.*` layout to PEP 621-compliant `[project]` table.
* Included filter response curves via `importlib.resources`.
* Tests pass under Python 3.9 and 3.11.

### Known Issues

* DRIFT-PHOENIX, SPHINX, and MPS-Atlas models require local caching.
* No automated validation for model grid completeness.
* No test coverage for all interpolation edge cases.
